                <h4>Should you watch it?</h4>
                <p>If you are obsessed with Jude Law as much as we are, this film is totally for you! Just imagine 107 minutes of heaven watching how Jude Law walking in his perfect siut, drinking champangne and being absolutely charming.
                    <aside>
                        Did you know something about the director of The nest? Sean Durkin, who you are?
                        <br> First of all The nest is his first movie where he is a director. He was a part of such famous projects as Martha Marcy May Marlene, Mary last seen and new The Rental.
                    </aside>
                    The nest is a beautiful drama with a hint of a horror, that makes it even tastier. So we think that The nest is a perfect debut for our Sean and we are definitely looking foward to see new his projects! Congrats!<br>

                    </aside>

                <h4>Did you miss true detectives?</h4>
                <p>Today Netflix pleases us with a large number of shows and movies. But are all of them worth watching?
                    <aside>
                        Did you know something about Enola Holms? <br> Besides she is a Sherlock's sister?
                        <br> Yeah, as we do.
                    </aside>
                    <aside>
                        Enola Holms is definetly well fillmed, but we have so much questions to the cast and film script. Henry Cavill as Sherlock? Are you kidding us? Enola Holms looks like a nice story for kids but if you are older than 13, you definetly will have some questions.
                        But if you are not such nerds as we are, you should watch this naive and predictable story at least because of charming Louis Partridge, who was absolutely adorable in this movie. We know who will be your celebrity crush after
                        this!
